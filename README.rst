using git to save my vim config
-------------------------------

I am a vim user and I couldn't care less what other developer use. I like developers to care about what they use themselves though.

I need to edit files on many different computers and like the experience to be consistant.

I clone this repository::

    git clone https://github.com/3kwa/vim-config.git .vim

Then create a symbolic link to the ''vimrc'' file::

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

And I am set!

Python_ is my favourite programming language ;)
